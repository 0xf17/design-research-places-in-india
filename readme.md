**Foreword.**
Learning about more design students failing to find and secure design research positions in India, I have tried looking for places like design studios, institutions, research labs, or any other, where students or anyone else might want to look when starting their research. People likely have different connotations of 'Design Research' and possibly misunderstand in many cases too. This list aims to crowdsource a list of places where newcomers may use as an initial list of places where they may pursue Design Research. But without labeling them with any tags, reviews, domains so it purely remains a crowdsourced list and not any authoritative one. Feel free to add ones that you may know.

Some snippets that I think that captures state-of-the-art shared understanding of 'Design Research'. _I will add more to this list over the time._

Demystifying 'Design Research': Design is not Research, Research is Design, by Trygve Faste and Haakon Faste (2012) [[PDF]](https://www.idsa.org/sites/default/files/Faste.pdf)
> The past decade has seen tremendous interest in design and “design research” from a multitude of perspectives in industry and academia. Indeed, the term “design research” has become part of the common vernacular in the field of design and is increasingly used to describe a myriad of possible approaches, perspectives, philosophies and methods. To give just one example, design research conducted by academics—which tends to lead to insights documented in scientific publications—is drastically different from research conducted by product design practitioners where the intent is to capture design insights and embed them in artifacts.

> Research is generally defined as a systematic investigation that establishes novel facts, solves new or existing problems, proves new ideas, or develops new theories. It is primarily associated with the search for knowledge, especially in the sciences and technological fields. Design, in contrast, deals with the act of planning and communicating a course of action to others, usually through the creative exploration of an area of interest. Charles Eames defined design as “A plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose.” (Neuhart et al. 1989) The term “design research” combines these two reasonably well-understood areas of practice, research and design, resulting in a seemingly meaningful merger roughly equivalent to the investigation of knowledge through purposeful design. In this regard numerous authors have articulated design research as both the study of design and the process of knowledge production that occurs through the act of design (e.g. Biggs 2002, Laurel 2003, Fallman 2007, Koskinen et al 2011). Yet because the term has become so broadly used in practice without being fully understood beyond the conjunction of design with research, particularly in academic circles, it has come to mean widely differing things to different people. Indeed, Krippendorff (2007) has argued that in actuality design research is an oxymoron “whose contradictions, because they are not obvious to everyone, can lead its naïve users into thinking of it as a kind of research similar to what reputable scientists do.” Rather, a comprehensive understanding of the term requires sensitivity to the cultural nuances and contextual differences across subdomains of research and design.

Investigating Design: A Review of Forty Years of Design Research by Nigan Bayazit (2004) [[Article]](https://direct.mit.edu/desi/article-abstract/20/1/16/60104/Investigating-Design-A-Review-of-Forty-Years-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
> What is Design Research? This paper will start to answer the above question with the definition of L. Bruce Archer: “Design research is systemic inquiry whose goals is knowledge of, or in, the embodiment of configuration, composition, structure, purpose, value and meaning in human-made things and systems.”

> In this paper, looking at design research from the design methodology and design science perspectives restricts our view in a sense that is necessary for such a topic. Design research tries to answer the obligations of design to the humanities:

> (a) Design research is concerned with the physicial embodiment of human-made things, how these things perform their jobs, and how they work, (b) Design research is concerned with construction as a human activity, how designers work, how they think, and how they carry out design activity, (c) Design research is concerned with what is achieved at the end of a purposeful design activity, how an artificial thing appears, and what it means, (d) Design research is concerned with the embodiment of configurations, (e) Design research is a systematic search and acquisition of knowledge related to design and design activity.
